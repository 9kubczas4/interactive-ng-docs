# Clean Code Practices

## Overview

Clean code is code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. It follows consistent conventions and is self-documenting.

## Key Principles

### 1. Meaningful Names

- Use descriptive and pronounceable names
- Avoid misleading names
- Use searchable names

### 2. Functions

- Keep functions small
- Do one thing well
- Use descriptive names
- Minimize function parameters

### 3. Comments

- Explain why, not what
- Keep comments up to date
- Avoid redundant comments

### 4. Formatting

- Use consistent indentation
- Keep line length reasonable
- Group related code together

## Angular-Specific Best Practices

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow Angular style guide
- Use reactive patterns with RxJS
- Implement proper component lifecycle
- Use OnPush change detection when appropriate

## Tools

- ESLint for code quality
- Prettier for consistent formatting
- SonarQube for code analysis
