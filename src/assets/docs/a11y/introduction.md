## What is Web Accessibility?

Web accessibility means designing and developing websites, tools, and technologies so that people with disabilities can use them effectively. This includes people with:

- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** international standard

### Business Benefits

- Larger audience reach (15% of global population)
- Improved SEO and site performance
- Better user experience for everyone
- Reduced legal risk

### Ethical Responsibility

- Equal access to information
- Digital inclusion
- Social responsibility

## Accessibility in Angular

Angular provides excellent built-in support for accessibility:

### CDK A11y Module

- **Focus management** - FocusTrap, FocusMonitor
- **Screen reader support** - AriaLiveAnnouncer

- Maintain proper focus management
- Use ARIA labels appropriately

## Getting Started

1. **Learn the basics** - Understand WCAG guidelines

3. **Test early and often** - Integrate accessibility into development
4. **Get feedback** - Include users with disabilities in testing
